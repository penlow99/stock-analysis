## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The following chart visualizes this relationship.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This section of the project was used to analyze the relationship between the outcomes of the campaigns for plays and the monetary goals those campaigns hoped to acheive.
The following chart visualizes this relationship.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
For some reason I still am not able to discern, Excel will automatically sort numbers in the fields of charts, in a left to right format with no regard for the value of the actual number. 
I had to manually rearrange the "Goals" order in the second chart to properly display the results.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best time to start a theater campaign is would definitely be the month of May, as the number of successes increases drastically in relation to the number of failures.
2. The end of the year is not a good time to start a new campaign, with December having the worst correlation between success and failure.
---
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the goal, the more successful a campaign will be, with the noted exception of high budget plays with goals between $35,000 and $44,999. Also, campaigns for plays apparently do not get canceled.
---
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data cannot account for demographics, such as popularity of the subject matter or age of the backers.
---
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Tables that show the correlation between length of campaigns and the outcomes of those campaigns, possibly using yearly quarters to help narrow down a better campaign window for Louise.
